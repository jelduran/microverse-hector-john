      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
        be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
        Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
        form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }greetMe("World");</code>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>


    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
        continuity of information from one invocation
        to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code
      </p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code>
      <ol>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.</p>
      <code>var x = 42.</code>
      <code>x = 42.</code>
      <code>let y = 13.</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. </p>
